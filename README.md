# Pathway Interactive App

This is an interactive GUI-based application that allows users to explore different biological pathways. Users can select a pathway from the dropdown menu, view a description of the selected pathway, and see an accompanying image.

## Features

- Select a pathway from the dropdown menu.
- View a detailed description of the selected pathway.
- Display an image associated with the selected pathway.
- Currently supports pathways such as the Krebs Cycle, Glycolysis, and Electron Transport Chain.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed (`tkinter` and `PIL`).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository's directory.

```bash
cd Pathway-Interactive-App
```

4. Run the app using Python:

```bash
python pathways.py
```

5. The GUI window will appear. Select a pathway from the dropdown menu and click the "Show Pathway" button to view the description and image.

## Pathways and Images

The app currently supports the following pathways and their respective images:

- Krebs Cycle: `krebs_cycle.png`
- Glycolysis: `glycolysis.png`
- Electron Transport Chain: `electron_transport_chain.png`

You can add more pathways and images by following the existing structure in the `pathway_images` dictionary within the `pathways.py` script.
